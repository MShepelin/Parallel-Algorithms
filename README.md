# Parallel algorithms with CUDA

A lot of Machine learning tasks related to computational geometry and topology can heavily benefit from the usage of parallel algorithms executed on GPU. However, today there are not many tools for this field of Computer Science. That is why we developed "Brighting" - a library of gpu-driven parallel algorithms for geometry and topology.

## Installation

Use python setup.py install in "src" folder to add parallelrank package to your python environment.
